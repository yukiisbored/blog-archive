<div class="paragraph"><p>Hello world, it&#8217;s been a long time since I write something. Well, due to
a lot of constraints like school, work, and some other stuff. It&#8217;s hard
to find a good time and mood to write something.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You probably noticed that the whole site change. In fact, it&#8217;s not just
the looks of it but the whole infrastructure and setup.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I replaced Jekyll with Pelican due to a number of things:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
It&#8217;s complex to utilize
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It&#8217;s confusing for most of the time
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It mainly uses markdown
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sure, this is <strong>really</strong> opinionated but really this is just a tool that I
as the user uses to generate static pages and publish it on Github pages.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The main reason why I like Pelican more than Jekyll is simplicity of usage,
clear documentation, and extensibility. I just don&#8217;t find Jekyll to be a
really nice tool for my needs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Not to mention that I can write in AsciiDoc instead of the absurd mess that
everyone loves, Markdown.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I really don&#8217;t like Markdown because of it&#8217;s ambiguity and weird nature. It
was never made to be a good markup language. The main sole purpose of Markdown
is to be parsed to HTML and make it "easier" to write. It&#8217;s not mainly made
to write papers, books, nor articles. Not to mention a lot of good stuff are
lacking.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, I won&#8217;t be signing my blog posts because I commonly lose my PGP keys.
Well, that&#8217;s just bad on my part and I&#8217;m looking a good way to utilize PGP
and pEp seems to be a good project making it easier for normal people to
use it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Still, I&#8217;m looking for a good way to backup my private keys encrypted. I find
keybase cloud encryption backup to be quite confusing because I can&#8217;t find a
way to get the keys to my system by any means.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Actually, the main reason I don&#8217;t want to sign my blog posts is because I can&#8217;t
find a good way to embed it without having junk on the rendered document.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve been working a lot on <a href="https://solar.coala.io">solar</a> lately and not much on
Loklak. Well, this is because I favor system administration work over programming.
I&#8217;m not quite sure which one I should take because programming is starting to be
a more of a hobby thing for me. Sure, I still <strong>love</strong> creating and writing free
software but I just love doing "DevOps"/sysadmin work more. This is probably
because I&#8217;m heavily addicited to *nix systems.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I also built my own retro gaming machine with my Raspberry Pi 3 and it&#8217;s really
awesome. I use RetroPie but not the image file because downloading it is too slow
to the point it just fails (smh github releases). So I ended up using raspbian and
install it manually. I can finally relax with Chrono Trigger and Castlevania &lt;3.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I just watched KonoSuba season 2 and it was funny as the first season. I find it
amusing how unique and charming the whole anime is and I&#8217;m looking forward for
the next season. I also find it quite unique to parody SAO but with more quality
than it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I read Re:Life and I haven&#8217;t read the new chapters
since February. Please don&#8217;t mail me spoilers ;w;, I want to read it someday.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I also find it amusing that I can surpass to the province level at the type of
event that I really hate with a passion which is Competitive Programming. Yes,
I joined the local """Computer""" Olympiad which is CP with more cringy and
cancerous elitism. I find some of the contestants quite amusing and I promote
Google Code-In and Besut Kode to the other contestants to my suprise nobody
even heard of the program. There were a handful of people who heard about it
but didn&#8217;t joined, I find it quite sad that the ministry of education promotes
total garbage that won&#8217;t even be used in their carreer over an actual free
and open source software contributor kickstarter like GCI that would look
fucking gorgeous on the Resume/CV.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The goverment doesn&#8217;t care by any means about Free and Open Source Software.
They&#8217;ll use pirated copies of Windows, Office, and some other cancerous shites.
The ministry of education has failed to educate the people on ownership and
copyright because they&#8217;re the ones who distributes pirated copies of Windows
Server 2012 to schools via VirtualBox Hard Drive images for their Computer based
National Exams program. I find it to be quite a bang to the head. It&#8217;s ironic
where the president of Indonesia wants a war with pirated goods but his own
goverment keeps pirating Windows, Office, and a mountain of things.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here&#8217;s a tip <strong>promote free software</strong> also <strong>free</strong> as in <strong>free speech</strong> not <strong>free beer</strong>.
I believe free software can help the country to become better and more
transparent. Free software promotes diversity, collaboration, and teaches people.
Unlike non-free software where nobody can learn from it or improve it other than
the sole owner. Besides, I really don&#8217;t like the fact pirated software are sold
publicly without any shame. It&#8217;s like selling tobacco without regulations and
freely to everyone.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And here I am building networks and servers for my school with solely free
software. Setup an awesome instance of Moodle for my school and setup the
students' wifi with pfSense and OpenWRT. It proved to be a reliable choice.
In fact, We did comparison with pfSense on a Modern Pentium Machine vs
Routerboard running MikroTik. pfSense proved to be more faster and lesser
latency than the expensive routerboard.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Why use non-free software and even worse pirating it, use <strong>free software</strong> and
share it with your friends and neighbors.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Man, I sound like Richard Stallman all of the sudden. Even though I like how BSD
does things than GNU/Linux. Sorry, Stallman.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s been a terribly long time since I write code in Go. I find it amusing
because it&#8217;s my favorite language of all time. This is probably the fact the orgs
I mainly work with is using Java or Python and none of them uses Go daily.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m also becoming a GSoC mentor mostly for experiences and helping coala. I&#8217;m
hoping I can still join GSoC, if not I&#8217;ll probably do X.org EVOC instead.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Man, this is really turing out to be a really long post where I blab mostly about
what&#8217;s going on lately. I should blog more often just to get stuff out of my chest.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s this beauty in Emacs when you use it for writing. It&#8217;s really really smooth
unlike anything. I don&#8217;t like word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer,
etc. I just find them to be quite ambigious and find their shortcuts to be mundane.
I write faster with AsciiDoc on Emacs. That&#8217;s just how it is.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since I got this blazing new laptop, I can finally listen to music, write stuff, do
a mountain of other things while doing heavy load in the background like compiling.
This Lenovo Ideapad running i7 Kabylake is seriously too good to be true on this
price and it is. Sure, it has a really annoying problem because it uses realtek
wifi which is absolute crap on Linux but that&#8217;s okay I guess I&#8217;ll just buy a wifi
dongle that uses Atheros.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, GCI Experience post&#8230; Yeah&#8230; probably later.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s about it, I guess.
Thanks for reading this really really long blab which I doubt anyone to be reading it.</p></div>
