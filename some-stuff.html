<div class="paragraph"><p>Accepting something is hard. There&#8217;s a lot of things that I said in the past and
regretting it in the future.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I used to hate Ruby because at first glance it&#8217;s hard to read and confusing, I
remember having a pretty heated conversation with a friend about it. Well, after
a few moments of actually learning Ruby, I fell in love with it and started
hating Python and became a Ruby fanboy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s common for me to immediately hating after becoming a fanboy or watching a
video on hating X. Yeah, I know it&#8217;s pretty childish and I&#8217;m trying to not do it.
It&#8217;s pretty hard nowadays to build my own genuine opinions after seeing someone
else&#8217;s opinions, especially the ones you trust.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An old friend of mine told me on the last presidential election that I became an
immediate fanboy of the losing campaign. Well, yeah, that was on elementary
school. That&#8217;s because my family supports the losing campaign and I follow tehm.
But, I noticed that I&#8217;m doing the same nowadays, which I regret.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On my last blog post, I wrote the fact that I hate competitive programming. Well,
I still don&#8217;t like the idea of competitive programming, but the hate is getting
smaller after interacting with the mentors. I wrote "cancerous elitism" probably
because I was really pissed that this competition is taking my schedule a lot.
Anyway, I still don&#8217;t like it and it should be considered as a not-so-needed
skill, because in practice stuff like what competitive programming is practicing
is really rare. Not a lot of people are writing their own sorting function, you
use what&#8217;s inside your language&#8217;s standard library. Not a lot of people are
writing their own OpenGL or software renderer, people use game engines or
libraries like SDL.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I think competitive programming shouldn&#8217;t be prioritized as the competition for
measuring computer/programming skills. I remember one of the mentors talks about
his experience in collaborating with other people on a project and how it&#8217;s
unpleasant. His problems were inconsistent code style, unreadable code, etc. Well,
that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I think something like Google Code-in should be
prioritized over something like competitive programming. Why? Because in GCI
you contribute to actual free software projects and practice collaborating with
other people and collective work. You&#8217;ll know how to contribute, how to work with
other people, and useful stuff that keeps the project going stable and maintainable
like Version control systems (ex. <span class="monospaced">git</span>), linters (ex.<span class="monospaced">coala</span>), static code analysis,
continous integration (ex. <span class="monospaced">travis</span>), documentation tools (ex. <span class="monospaced">docutils</span>), etc.
Not to mention, when you contribute to free software, you&#8217;ll get criticsm from
other programmers. This criticsm is important to improve your skills and be a lot
better. So you won&#8217;t be a turtle inside your shell and keep doing the same crap
forever.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, someone called me the Indonesian version of Stallman because I prefer FLOSS
a lot and use it over nonfree software. Well, they&#8217;re not wrong, but I&#8217;m not <strong>that</strong>
hardcore because I still rely on nonfree software/services like Telegram, Twitter,
Github, etc.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I got a coala.io email address which is sweet. It&#8217;s <a href="mailto:yuki@coala.io">yuki@coala.io</a> and I really
wanna use it more. For now, I&#8217;m still using <a href="mailto:yukinagato@protonmail.com">yukinagato@protonmail.com</a> as my main
email. I&#8217;m still waiting for IMAP support, etc. Most likely i&#8217;ll just set it to
forward to my main email. Who knows.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, you may notice a new look on my blog. Well, I really want an improved and
more readable look of it. At first, I wanna try make my own theme but I really
suck at front-end (I would never be as good as <a href="https://github.com/hemangk">@hemangsk</a>).
So, I ended up forking Pure theme and make some changes, like make the sidebar
to be sexy pink and change some other stuff like my waifu on the corner.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, I can&#8217;t come up with titles for my posts, because most of them are just
"updates" or something that I have in mind.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I dockerized <a href="https://gitmate.io">GitMate</a> and really like the result, there are
some bugs that I&#8217;ll fix tomorrow or later. I&#8217;m still pretty stressed with the
bugs that came up on production, which I hope we can find the source. We probably
need more eyeballs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>My birthday is coming up, but I won&#8217;t be getting any presents because my Dad
already bought me a really awesome laptop. Which is okay. Another thing that I
wanna do after I&#8217;m 17 is to create a National ID card and create a new bank
account so I can actually receive money from various freelancing work.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m really grateful for everything that happened to me in this year. I won GCI
2016, working for FLOSS organizations, freelancing on various projects. I&#8217;m really
lucky.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, after actually meeting with the other participants I noticed a lot of
interesting people. Since i&#8217;m on the province level and everything is more
concetrated. I can talk with more people and meet them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I wanna promote GCI to them at some time, probably when I lose on the province
level because I honestly doubt that I win. Some of the mentors has some hopes that
I win. But I honestly doubt that. If I do, I have no idea and very grateful to
Allah.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I really wanna tell people and promote FOSS to local programmers especially the
ones who wanna be programmers because it&#8217;s the most effective way to practice
and improve their skills. I&#8217;m hoping more people will join Besut Kode 2017. I don&#8217;t
know if I&#8217;ll be a mentor again this year, so yeah.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m really grateful and really wanna thank Wikimedia Indonesia for doing programs
and initiatives like Besut Kode, WikiLatih, etc. They&#8217;re really nice people and
are doing really awesome things. I wish more teachers, professors, people
contribute to Wikipedia Indonesia. You see, a lot of teachers don&#8217;t like Wikipedia
because of it&#8217;s "inaccurateness" and collective ways, I really want to tell them,
"If you know it&#8217;s wrong, fix it". Because it&#8217;s stupid to think something open and
collective will always be wrong even though there&#8217;s a lot of people who verifies
changes and reverts vandalism.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m also really grateful to be a part of coala and FOSSASIA. They&#8217;ve done a lot
for me, even if it&#8217;s indirect. They gave me experiences in FOSS, System
Administration experiences, etc. I wish I took more photos when I visit FOSSASIA
2017.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, I noticed a lot of the competitive programming mentors haven&#8217;t heard about
GSoC. Like seriously. They know Google Code Jam, but not GSoC. Well, I&#8217;m hoping
to promote it to them at some point of time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Talking about GSoC, I&#8217;m mentoring for coala this year. Which is awesome. I&#8217;m
hoping I can be a student for GSoC in the future. If not, I&#8217;ll probably join
Xorg&#8217;s EVOC.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>coala is considering doing it&#8217;s own summer coding program. Which is awesome,
no idea if it&#8217;ll be a thing or not though.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, yeah, I kinda wanna do things for Xorg in the future. I just don&#8217;t have the
time to learn the code base and more stuff about C and UNIX programming. I don&#8217;t
know if I can, but I&#8217;ll try.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another thing that I wanna do is more advanced stuff like Assembly/Low Level
programming. Just as a hobby. I don&#8217;t know where should I start.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, right now, I really want a new ergonomic keyboard because my current one
is start to become a pain. Sure it&#8217;s not bad as the old one but it&#8217;s starts to
become a pain. I&#8217;m looking at the Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard and start saving
money for it. I don&#8217;t know if my parents would buy it for me or not because it&#8217;s
pretty expensive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I also wanna continue my Linux primer book, I&#8217;m hoping to that pretty soon,
because I wanna teach my friends the beauty of *nix operating systems.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyway, That&#8217;s it for now. This damn AsciiDoc file is fucking 143 lines long.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks,
