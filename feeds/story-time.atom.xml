&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s one of those question that I often ask myself personally, How did I get
here. How did I became a maintainer for two organizations, How did I get a
freelancing job for a startup in Germany, How did I win Google Code-In,
and Who am I before living â€¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div id="preamble"&gt;

&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s one of those question that I often ask myself personally, How did I get
here. How did I became a maintainer for two organizations, How did I get a
freelancing job for a startup in Germany, How did I win Google Code-In,
and Who am I before living inside a text editor from the 70s?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I can be really annoying and just say "I don&amp;#8217;t know". Because, I really
don&amp;#8217;t know. It&amp;#8217;s not an easy question and it&amp;#8217;s not the one where there&amp;#8217;s only
one answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to start somewhere I guess, so.. hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start by what makes me interested with Computers. Why am I wasting a
lot of time inside my home in a dark room with a keyboard and a screen to
fill the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was around 2006, my family just moved to a new home and after a while my dad
got home and he brought a bunch of boxes, it was a lot of boxes in various
sizes. My dad was assembling something, well I&amp;#8217;m not sure because most likely
I just sleep and gaze myself to the television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I saw a blue table on top of it is a bulky box that looks like
a TV, a thing with a lot of buttons, small curvy thing with a ball inside of it,
and lasty a tower painted black with silver buttons that electrocutes me every
time I press it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, It&amp;#8217;s a computer, my dad introduced me to it shortly and my memories are
fuzzy so I&amp;#8217;m not sure what happened. After a while, I got hooked&amp;#8230; on games
that were installed. It ran Windows 98 Second Edition and the game that I always
play on it was Daytona USA, Virtual Cop, and Tarzan. I don&amp;#8217;t know the
specifications of the computer. Hell, I don&amp;#8217;t know what a processor is and a
common misconception is I called the tower the "CPU" which is well, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a while, I got it running Windows XP and we had to move to my
grandma&amp;#8217;s house because my parents wanted to renovate the house. During my stay
at my grandma&amp;#8217;s, my dad brought me to this place where they sell a lot of CDs.
Well, we grabbed a bunch of games and the store offered me some free software
because we bought a lot of things, sure I wanted it. To my surprise, my dad
specifically picked this one green CD titled "Mandriva 2006". I didn&amp;#8217;t know what
it was back then, on the back cover it has pictures of penguins and on the front
cover it has a picture of a penguin. I remember gazing on the cover during the
ride back home, I wonder what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we got home, my dad installed it on my computer and introduced me to it. It
was there, KDE 3. I still remember the stuff that I like about it even to this
day I still remember how cool and customizable it is. The popular skeumorphism
look just was really appealing back then. I remember try and see what every
single button does. I even notice this thing called "root", when I asked my dad
what it is and what&amp;#8217;s with the background which is a tile of bombs, he replied
with "don&amp;#8217;t use it your computer will explode". Looking at back it, I think he
just want me to not break the system, but back then I was scared and kept myself
away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also remember trying out SUSE Linux (before it was called openSUSE) after my
dad introduced me to this magazine called "InfoLinux" and Ubuntu after the house
renovation is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was an odd kid back then, I was still a cry-baby, I don&amp;#8217;t know how everything
worked back then, and I usually find myself interested in odd and unfamiliar
things, like computers. It wasn&amp;#8217;t a common thing in Indonesia back in the day,
unlike in western countries where it&amp;#8217;s normal for kids to use a computer and
use the Internet. It wasn&amp;#8217;t common back then, Internet was a thing for people
who have a lot of money and dial up was the choice for most people. I still
remember the advertisement for Telkom&amp;#8217;s old Dial-up service. I remember that
I was intrigued looking at ad where a telephone line is plugged into a laptop
and they have to dial this number. Well, I always wondered what the Internet is
back in the day. I remember my dad used to connect to the Internet with a some
sort of USB Modem. I don&amp;#8217;t know what it was, but I remember I found out it&amp;#8217;s a
USB Bluetooth and he probably connected it to his phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While writing this, I don&amp;#8217;t have a clear timeline of my life. I didn&amp;#8217;t bother
to write a diary back then. So stuff will most likely mixed up but I do have a
clear timeline on some memorable moments but I remember them not on age but on
what grade of school I&amp;#8217;m on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was an odd kid back then, I remember on the third grade me with a
couple of friends sitting and talking to each other&amp;#8230; about how people kill
themselves at this building that we looked at. Yes, I find it to be an odd topic
as well and my parents would worried about me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my 8th birthday, my dad got me a new computer. An Intel Core 2 Duo machine
with a whopping 2GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce. I was suprised and happy. I
remember my dad teased me about an Intel Core 2 Duo PC on Ramadhan. It had
Ubuntu installed, I think it was 6.04 and Windows XP. Also, my dad installed
Compiz. Which is this magical box of desktop effects. I remember playing with it
for a long time. Desktop cubes, wobbling windows, etc. Enabling and playing with
every single effect. It was fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a while, my dad got Internet installed. Sweet, I remember after installing
when testing the Internet, the guy opened YouTube and a Tom and Jerry video. I
was like what&amp;#8217;s this?. My mom was worried about it though because she thought it
may have porn on it. Well, I didn&amp;#8217;t listen because I was interested. I remember
she used to watch a lot of ghost videos but what I usually watch is a lot of
tech videos. Like people running old versions of Windows on computers or consoles
running Ubuntu or homebrew and a lot of stuff. I remember the notepad videos and
the infamous Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape. A lot of people got annoyed
with the sond, but I like it. Anyway, YouTube is also the reason why I got
interested in this the electronics genre of music. Back then, I remember listening
to Daft Punk. I remember while going back home from School, my friends were having
a quiz about music artists and I mentioned Daft Punk. They didn&amp;#8217;t know about it and
thought I was making stuff up. Well, I like Daft Punk a lot back then, even today I
still find their songs to be really good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think I was at the 9th grade that I started playing with Visual Basic. I
remember that I had VB 6.0 back in the day, it was like 2006 but I&amp;#8217;m really not
sure when because I had Linux installed and I know I had Windows XP before and after
it, but really I&amp;#8217;m not sure. Anyway, I remember playing around with the program and
started doing some crappy Internet browser, a crappy "OS" which is really just a
shell. I still know it&amp;#8217;s "programming" but I didn&amp;#8217;t know how to program, what I did
is just placing buttons and other GUI components and played around with the
properties and I did some tutorials from YouTube videos. Most of the time I just
copy-paste code and see what it does. From there, like most people with old 80s
BASIC games book, I know a bit of Visual Basic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 5th grade, my dad got me into a Java course at Nurul Fikri. More on that
later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I have problems with is telling stories parts of my life.
It&amp;#8217;s the feeling of I don&amp;#8217;t want to miss stuff but I have to or it&amp;#8217;ll be really
really long. I remember on a trip a teacher wanted me to tell the other students
on how I won GCI and it ended up being 30 mins long. Well, yeah. I&amp;#8217;m not a good
speaker without something like slides or notes to limit my scope. Anyway, on this
blog post I can have the audacity to list them all and make this long, but I don&amp;#8217;t
want to. Because it&amp;#8217;ll be days to write and will have more words than your usual
Russian novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More on Part 2(?). I don&amp;#8217;t know when that will happen because it&amp;#8217;s pretty rare for
me to have time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Thanks for reading this long post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
